      This library provides a unified interface to read/write EEG file format
      in realtime. It has been designed to provide a consistent and common
      interface to all supported file formats while minimizing the CPU cost
      on the main loop.
      It thus performs all the expensive operation (scaling, data convertion
      and file operation) in a separated thread.
    build-depends:
      - mmlib-devel
    build-system : meson
